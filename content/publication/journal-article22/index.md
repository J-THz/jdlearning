abstract: A method for reducing diffraction interference in ultrasonic shear wave transducer is introduced in this article. Basing on the principle of liquid viscosity measurement by ultrasonic shear wave, the source of the diffraction wave is analyzed. The method improves the quality of the echo signal and increases the signal to noise ratio by optimizing the geometry of the buffer rod to adjust the flight time of the diffraction waves. The method has been applied in the measurement of liquid viscosity using ultrasonic shear waves with simple principle and remarkable effect.
