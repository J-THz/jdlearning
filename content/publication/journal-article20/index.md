abstract: Glass fiber-reinforced composite laminates in polyetherimide resin have been studied via terahertz imaging and ultrasonic C-scans. The forced delamination is created by inserting Teflon film between various layers inside the samples prior to consolidating the laminates. Using reflective pulsed terahertz imaging, we find high-resolution, low-artifact terahertz C-scan and B-scan images locating and sizing the delamination in three dimensions. Furthermore, terahertz imaging enables us to determine the thicknesses of the delamination and of the layers constituting the laminate. Ultrasonic C-scan images are also successfully obtained; however, in our samples with small thickness-to-wavelength ratio, detailed ultrasonic B-scan images providing quantitative information in depth cannot be obtained by 5 MHz or 10 MHz focused transducers. Comparative analysis between terahertz imaging and ultrasonic C-scans with regard to spatial resolution is carried out demonstrating that terahertz imaging provides higher spatial resolution for imaging, and can be regarded as an alternative or complementary modality to ultrasonic C-scans for this class of glass fiber-reinforced composites.
