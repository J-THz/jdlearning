abstract: We demonstrate a single-shot ultrafast terahertz photography system that can capture multiple frames of a complex ultrafast scene in non-transparent media with sub-picosecond temporal resolutions. By multiplexing an optical probe beam in the time and spatial-frequency domains simultaneously, we encode the terahertz-captured spatiotemporal dynamics into distinct spatial-frequency regions of a multiplexed image, which is then computationally decoded and reconstructed.
