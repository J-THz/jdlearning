abstract: "In this work, we demonstrate a single-shot ultrafast terahertz imaging system that can capture multiple frames of a complex ultrafast scene in non-transparent media with sub-picosecond temporal resolutions. By multiplexing an optical probe beam in the time and spatial-frequency domains simultaneously, we encode the terahertz-captured spatiotemporal dynamics into distinct spatial-frequency regions of a superimposed image, which is then computationally decoded and reconstructed. Our technique provides a new diagnostic tool for the investigation of non-repeatable or destructive ultrafast phenomena that occur in optically-opaque scenarios. "
