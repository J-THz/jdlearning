abstract: In this work, we introduce a versatile metal-wire waveguide geometry, namely a four-wire waveguide, which is capable of sustaining two independent and orthogonally polarized fundamental modes, thus acting as a broadband polarization-division multiplexer. By integrating multiscale-structured grooves into the wires of such a waveguide, we demonstrate the independent manipulation of polarization-division terahertz signals.
