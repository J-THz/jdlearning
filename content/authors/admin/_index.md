I define myself as a research scientist working on terahertz science and technology. 

My research career has been shaped by a global perspective. Coming from a Chinese family, I pursued my master's degree at [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/) before venturing to the United States for my Ph.D. degree at [Georgia Institute of Technology](https://www.gatech.edu/). During my Ph.D. studies, I had the incredible opportunity to go to Europe and conduct research in the joint international laboratory between [Georgia Tech](https://www.gatech.edu/) and [CNRS](https://www.cnrs.fr/en), the French national laboratory system. After obtaining my Ph.D. degree, I moved to Canada and joined [INRS](https://inrs.ca/en/), where I am currently based. 

I am passionate about exploring the fundamental principles and practical applications of [terahertz radiation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terahertz_radiation), particularly in the areas of imaging, sensing, and communications. Over the course of my career, I have achieved significant outcomes, resulting in 5 patents, 28 journal articles, and 31 conference papers. I aspire to develop innovative solutions that harness the potential of terahertz radiation, addressing real-world challenges and driving advancements in various applications. I am committed to staying at the forefront of terahertz research, collaborating with international partners, and making continuous contributions to the scientific community and society as a whole.
