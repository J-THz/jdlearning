As a researcher, I define myself with three words: global, terahertz, and up-and-coming. 

Firstly, my research career has been shaped by a global perspective. Coming from a Chinese family, I pursued my master's degree at [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/) before venturing to the United States for my Ph.D. studies at [Georgia Tech](https://www.gatech.edu/). During my Ph.D. study, I had the incredible opportunity to conduct research in the joint international laboratory between [Georgia Tech](https://www.gatech.edu/) and [CNRS](https://www.cnrs.fr/en), the French national laboratory system. After obtaining my Ph.D. degree, I moved to Canada and joined [INRS](https://inrs.ca/en/), where I am currently based. 

Secondly, my research focuses on terahertz (THz) science and technology. I am passionate about exploring the fundamental principles and practical applications of [THz radiation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terahertz_radiation), particularly in the areas of imaging, sensing, and communications. This field presents exciting possibilities for pushing the boundaries of what is possible in terms of understanding and utilizing [THz radiation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terahertz_radiation).

Lastly, I consider myself an up-and-coming researcher with ~10 years of experience in the THz field. Over the course of my career, I have achieved significant outcomes, resulting in 5 patents, 28 journal articles, and 31 conference papers. These results have been driven by my dedication to advancing knowledge in the THz domain and making continuous contributions to the community.

I aspire to develop innovative solutions and technologies that harness the potential of [THz radiation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terahertz_radiation), addressing real-world challenges and driving advancements in various applications. I am committed to staying at the forefront of THz research, collaborating with international partners, and making a positive impact on the scientific community and society as a whole.
