I am currently a tenure-track assistant professor in the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science ([EECS](https://electrical-engineering.uark.edu/)) at the [University of Arkansas](https://www.uark.edu/), working on terahertz ([THz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terahertz_radiation)) science and technology. 

My career has been shaped by a global perspective. I pursued my master's degree at [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/) before venturing to the United States for my Ph.D. degree at [Georgia Institute of Technology](https://www.gatech.edu/). During my Ph.D. studies, I had the incredible opportunity to go to Europe and conduct research in the joint international laboratory between [Georgia Tech](https://www.gatech.edu/) and [CNRS](https://www.cnrs.fr/en), the French national laboratory system. After obtaining my Ph.D. degree, I joined the National Institute of Scientific Research ([INRS](https://inrs.ca/en/)) in Canada, where I served as the group leader and managed research activities related to THz photonics. 

I am passionate about exploring the fundamental principles and practical applications of THz radiation, particularly in the areas of imaging, sensing, and communications. My work has been published in ~30 peer-reviewed journals, ~40 conference proceedings, and 5 patents. I am a member of IEEE, Optica, and SPIE.

[I am actively seeking enthusiastic and motivated students to join our group. Feel free to reach out if you are interested in working with me. Let's play with THz waves together!](/#contact)
